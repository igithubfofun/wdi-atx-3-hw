## When you search upon a star
  - We are going to create a star gazing app using ajax!
  - Using the provided starter code modify the stargazer.js file to bring up an image of the item searched! (*Note you will only need to change the stargazer.js file*)
  - [Here is the link](http://www.strudel.org.uk/lookUP/) where we are getting our jsonp data...That's right I said 'jsonp' (*hint hint that might be your dataType*)
  - You can see what the data looks like if you go to this example: http://www.strudel.org.uk/lookUP/json/?name=sun (*hint hint you may need to reference one of these key values... maybe more than one... then again maybe just one... or more... or one*).
